# Use Cursor for everything

This workspace is set up so the user does all development from Cursor (tasks, terminal, agent). See **.vscode/CURSOR-FOR-EVERYTHING.md** for the user-facing guide.

## Node/npm commands
- **Always** run npm/node via the **global** script so it works in agent-run terminals and in tasks:
  - **`/Users/mac/.cursor/scripts/with-node.sh`**
- Examples (from repo root):
  - Install deps in Farm-Fresh-Meats:  
    `ROOT="Farm-Fresh-Meats" /Users/mac/.cursor/scripts/with-node.sh npm install`
  - Run Farm-Fresh-Meats:  
    `ROOT="Farm-Fresh-Meats" /Users/mac/.cursor/scripts/with-node.sh npm run dev`
- Tasks **Run Farm-Fresh-Meats (full app)** and **Preview site (Python server)** are in .vscode/tasks.json; prefer running via **Run Task** so the user stays in Cursor.

## Repo layout
- **Repo root**: static site (index.html, assets), serve.py, login/, dashboard/, deploy/, docs/.
- **Farm-Fresh-Meats/**: full Replit app (client + server + Supabase). Run with `npm run dev` (via with-node.sh) on port 5000.

## Python
- Local preview server: `python3 serve.py` (port 8888). No wrapper needed.

## Git
- Use from repo root. SSH is configured for GitHub; cPanel deploy is via cron + .cpanel.yml.
